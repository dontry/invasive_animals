        (MIT) Specialised in IT and development. Patrick Mo (MDS) Specialised in
        Data science and data management Tram Ngo (MIT) Specialised in
        reporting writing and project management. Our research shows, major
        threat is present to the Victorian environment. Invasive species cause a
        huge damage to the Victorian plant and animal species. Each year the
        Victorian Government spends nearly $900 million to prevent the attack of
        invasive species.
